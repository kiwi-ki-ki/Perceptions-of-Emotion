# Perceptions-of-Emotion

This independent project was a replica of a 2011 study done by Lott et. al., determining people's ability to percieve facial and bodily expressions as emotions. 

Participants completed two trials, one for facial expressions and one for body language, after being shown a vignette the participants were given three emotion choices, anger, happiness, or sadness, and the participants were to choose one of the three emotions. The perticipants were tested on accuracy and response time. 

The facial expressions were black adn white to lower biases or unecessary stimuli. Each animation was one secodn long and during that time period, exactly one facila expression is made from which the participant is to make an informed guess about the emotion the face made.

The body expression vignettes were comprised of 13 dots denoting major joints of the body. The animations are one second long and each perfroms one movement from which the participants is to assume an emotion.

The experiment was run through PsychoPY, which utilizes Python, the data was collected vis Pavlovia, and the data analysis was done in R utilizing R studio. 

The attached files inlcude the raw data extracted from Pavlovia, the data analysis in R, and the final paper summarizing the replica study.
